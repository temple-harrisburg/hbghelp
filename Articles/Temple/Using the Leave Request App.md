Requests for the use of personal, vacation, and sick leave allotments should be submitted to the operations manager through the [Leave Request App](https://tuprd.sharepoint.com/sites/hbg/SitePages/Leave-Request.aspx?source=https%3A%2F%2Ftuprd.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2Fhbg%2FSitePages%2FForms%2FByAuthor.aspx) available on the Harrisburg SharePoint.

## Submitting a Leave Request

1. Use the **Leave Request App** to submit your request.
2. For requests that involve a combination of full and partial days:
    1. In the app, select "Multiple Days" and input the amount of days using a decimal _(i.e. "1.5" Days)._
    2. Add any helpful notes regarding your request using the "Note to Approvers" field if desired.
3. A _confirmation email_ is sent to you before notifying your supervisor and the business manager.
    1. Check the confirmation email for errors.
    2. Select [ **Cancel** ] and start over if you need to make a change.
    3. Select [ **Confirm** ] to notify your supervisor and the business manager via email.
4. Leave requests must be **Approved** or **Rejected** by your supervisor and the business manager.
    1. Requests are not approved until both parties select [ **Approve** ]
    2. Requests will be rejected immediately if either party selects [ **Reject** ]
        1. The supervisor and/or business manager must provide notes for any rejections _(i.e. "Insufficient time for this request")_
    3. Once a request is approved or rejected, a final outcome email will be sent to the requester, the supervisor, and the business manager with the details and notes.

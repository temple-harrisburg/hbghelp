### Troubleshooting a Second Monitor

#### First Steps

- Confirm the monitor power cable is plugged in and the monitor's physical power switch is in the **on** position.
- If the monitor has multiple inputs, confirm it's set to use the input your device is connected to. See [Types of Connections](#types-of-connections) below.
- Make sure the cable connecting the computer and monitor is plugged in all the way and secure.
- [Open your computer's Display Settings](#find-the-display-settings) and see if the second monitor is showing up.

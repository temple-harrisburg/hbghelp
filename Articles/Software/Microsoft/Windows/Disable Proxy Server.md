Temple computers are configured to use a proxy server by default. The Temple proxy server helps anonymize your internet traffic and protect your device from potentially malicious websites, but in many cases it blocks access to websites you need for work.

### How to disable the proxy server

1. Search for **Proxy Settings** in the Windows 10/11 search bar
2. Toggle **Automatically detect settings** to "Off"
3. If a proxy server in configured, disable it.

Accessing Wi-Fi at Temple Harrisburg requires two steps: 1) Getting a password from "tuguestwireless", then 2) signing in to "tusecurewireless".

Once authenticated with the guest network, the credentials will be valid for 24 hours. Everyone in attendance may use the same credentials to sign in to the Wi-Fi.

### 1. Get a password from _tuguestwireless_

1. Connect your device to the wireless network labeled “**tuguestwireless**”
2. If a web browser does not automatically open, open a browser and attempt to navigate to a webpage (e.g. [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)).  An authentication page requesting your name and phone number will appear.
3. Enter your name and cellphone number.
4. You will receive a text message with a username and password.

### 2. Sign in to _tusecurewireless_

1. Connect your device to the wireless network labeled “tusecurewireless”
2. When prompted for a user ID and password, type in the following:
    - For the user ID, type in your 10-digit cell phone number.
    - For the password, type in your PIN code from the text message.
3. Check your wireless indicator to confirm you are now connected. 

### Troubleshooting

- If prompted to select an authentication method, select **PEAP**, then select "Do Not Authenticate" for the certificate field.
- Your phone number must be entered into tusecurewireless exactly as it was entered in the guest form.
- If you are still experiencing connection issues, wait a few minutes and try again.  Sometimes it may take 5-10 minutes for your authentication to clear.

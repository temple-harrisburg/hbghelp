The global scale and freedom-of-expression enabled by the internet has made it an invaluable resource for communicating and collaborating with people across the world, sharing information, and gathering freely-licensed works. But those same qualities also make the internet a hotbed for malicious activity. Malware, scareware, and phishing are just some of the many methods threat actors use to try to extort users for money, personally-identifying information, or national security secrets.

There are settings built-in to your web browser to help avoid pop-ups, scareware, and more. For an extra layer of security, third-party **extensions** help block everything from irritating, distracting ads and malicious pop-ups. 

Jump to the options for your browser:
- [Google Chrome](#google-chrome)
- [Microsoft Edge](#microsoft-edge)
- [Mozilla Firefox](#mozilla-firefox)
## Google Chrome
### Settings
#### [Block pop-ups](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95472?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
1.      On your computer, open Chrome.
2.      At the top right, click More > Settings.
3.      Click Privacy and security > Site Settings > Pop-ups and redirects.

You will see a few options that you can enable or disable. They are listed below.
#### Scareware Blocker
Microsoft's **Scareware blocker** is intended to detect and triage *scareware* attacks.

*Scareware* is a type of popup that uses full-screen popups, loud noises and false warnings that your computer has been compromised in order to cause alarm and get you to take action that will expose you to malicious actors while trying to resolve the issue.

#### Microsoft Defender SmartScreen
This feature screens websites for potential malware or phishing attempts, and warns you if you visit a page that may have these malicious element.s

#### Block potentially unwanted apps
**Potentially unwanted apps** (PUA) include adware (software that inserts additional ads into websites), bundled software, evasive software, and even spyware. Microsoft Edge screens for these types of software when you download something from the internet and warns you of the potential danger.

#### Website typo protection
Enabling this setting will show a warning when Edge suspects you may be trying to access an untrustworthy website with a similar name to a trusted website: a practice known as **typo squatting**.
__Typo squatting__ is the tactic used by threat actors where an actor purchases a domain name that is similar to a popular, trusted website's name, then copies the trusted site's appearance as a cover for a phishing attempt.

### Extensions

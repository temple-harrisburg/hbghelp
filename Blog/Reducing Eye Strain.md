The Mayo Clinic defines eyestrain as “a common condition that occurs when your eyes get tired from intense use, such as… staring at computer screens and other digital devices” for an extended period of time. Many jobs today involve a lot of screentime. There are some steps you can take to help alleviate this underdiscussed work-related hazard.

### 20-20-20 Rule

Every _20_ minutes, stare at something _20_ feet away for _20_ seconds. This can also be the 30-30-30 rule. Doing this regularly is meant to prevent the strain associated with focusing your eyes on something close to you for a long time.

### Monitor Placement

Your monitor should be at a distance that’s not too close, but not too far. Sitting too close to the monitor is associated with less blinking. Sitting too far away may cause you to strain to read what’s on the screen. Keep the monitor at least at arm’s distance, and keep the top of the screen level to your eyeline. You should be able to see the recycling bin or your browser’s search bar without looking up.

### Blue Light Filters

Most devices today come with a blue light filter. It might also be called a “night light”. The filter subtly decreases the amount of blue light emitted from a display, which gives the screen a yellowish tint. In addition to being easier on the eyes, it’s thought that exposure to blue light during the evening causes one’s body to stay alert longer, since blue light is associated with daylight. Filtering that blue light could potential prevent technological disruptions to your natural circadian rhythms.

### Extras

If you’re concerned about your eye health, you can make a few investments to go the extra mile.

#### Artificial tears

Your eyes can become dry over time from being exposes to the harsh light of a computer monitor for long durations. Using eye drops a few times a day can help alleviate the discomfort from dry eyes.

#### Blue-light filtering lenses

If you rely on glasses for reading, pay the extra money for blue-light filtering lenses.

Windows 10/11 provides a feature called **Virtual Desktops**. Virtual Desktops on Windows function similar to [tab groups](https://sites.temple.edu/hbghelp/2023/12/08/tech-spot-tab-groups/) in browsers— they act as separate workspaces to compartmentalize different tasks.

# Using Virtual Desktops in Windows 10/11

1. Click or hover on the **Task View** icon in your task bar
    - If the icon isn’t present, right-click an empty space of the task bar and select **Taskbar Settings**
    - Toggle the Task view switch to **On**
2. Select **New desktop**
3. To switch between desktops, hover on the Task View icon or hold Ctrl + Windows Key, then press the left or right arrow key.
4. To close desktops, hover or click on the Task View icon, then click on the X in the corner of the desktop tile you want to delete.

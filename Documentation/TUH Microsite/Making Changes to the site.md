Staff headshots are taken during onboarding, but the headshot can be changed upon request, with the following guidelines:

The photo must:

- Be take in bright, neutral light
- Be framed at least from the waist up
- Be taken straight-on, with the subject at the camera.
- Have a background that is either neutral or blurred

The photo must not:

- Be obviously doctored, such as by the use of filters. Subtle touch-ups such as removing glare from glasses or correcting skin tone washed out by the camera can be requested.

# Terminology

## Microsite

The Temple Harrisburg site.

## Paragraph

Any section of content in a page. Paragraphs are composed of components.

## Component

Pre-configured content blocks used to build microsite pages with a consistent visual identity. Components are limited in the information they can display, and there is a

## Block

Content within a component. Can be composed of text, icons, images, and other components. Most block content is pre-defined.

# Block Naming Conventions

Certain components (particularly the Image and Common Content component) contain reusable elements that can be made once then reused across pages. To keep these reusable elements consistent and easy to find, include the relevant topic (course, staff member, etc.) and type of component.

For example: if an image is uploaded to serve as the banner to the Grant Writing Certificate Program, it could be titled Grant Writing Banner. This allows other website admins searching for content to populate other Grant Writing-related pages to quickly find relevant blocks.

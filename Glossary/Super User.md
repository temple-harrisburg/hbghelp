Your Super User account is an account separate from your [[AccessNet]] with elevated permissions for interacting with IT systems. For example, you are required to use your super user account when trying to remotely access [[vapor]]. 

Your super user account will take the form `su-tu...@temple.edu`. 

You are required to change the password to your super user account every 42 days.

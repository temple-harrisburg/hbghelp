# Definition
StackOverflow (see also StackExchange and askubuntu.com) is a question-and-answer forum broadly covering IT topics. It will likely be in some of the first results you find when conducting web searches for solutions to technical problems.

The quality of answers is usually high, since top answers are vetted, edited, voted upon by forum users, and approved by the original question asker.

RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication". Many websites offer RSS feeds, which are web feeds that post updates made to a site. 

Temple University's [System Status Alerts](https://systemstatus.temple.edu/system/status) provides an RSS feed. You should have a lightweight reader on your primary workstation, such as the browser extension FeedBro, and subscribe to the System Status feed to get updates on outages or maintenance that may affect TUH.

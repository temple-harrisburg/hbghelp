# Definition
Free and Open-Source Software. This is software which is licensed for free usage and is modifiable (depending on the license). FOSS source code is publicly available and modifiable, and is usually hosted on a source code repository like GitHub. 

There is typically no warranty with this type of software.

Some examples of FOSS software we use regularly are Audacity, GIMP, [[Ubuntu]], and [[Xibo]].

# Definition
Reddit is primarily a popular social media website, but it also has sub-forums (subreddits) dedicated to IT topics and solutions. You may be able to find leads to solving technical problems on various subreddits related to your problem.

[[StackOverflow]] is a more reliable source of information, but posts on Reddit can sometimes have insight into very niche areas. 

It may also be helpful to subscribe to some subreddits on your personal time in order to keep up with trends in technology.
